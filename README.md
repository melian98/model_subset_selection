# model_subset_selection
This repository contains the files associated to practice with model subset selection. A set of predictor vectors were made and used to create a response vector. Other unrelated vectors were then made and the model was used to predict the predictors related to the response as well as outputting their coefficients. AIC, BIC and adjusted R squared were the methods used alongside forward and backward stepwise selection
